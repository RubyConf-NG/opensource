# opensource

A launchpad for all opensource projects from RubyConf-NG

This acts as initial documentation for ideation and brainstorming around
applications we want to develop as a community. This repository may not have
all projects in it. But those with extensive documentation, and
"pre-deliberation", may end up here before the project gets a repository of its
own.

### Folder Structure

This folder structure is also a WIP. As we define which bootstrapping method
works best for us, this structure would follow such methods

```
  <project name>
    |-- business requirement document
    |-- functional requirement document
```

## Contributing

Pull Requests are welcome for all projects. For concerns on any idea or
documentation, please opan an issue to discuss your concern. All major changes
to project documentation should be raised as pull requests against the
documentation file.
